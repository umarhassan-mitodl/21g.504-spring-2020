## Instructor Insights

Below, Wakana Maekawa describes various aspects of how she teaches *21G.504 Japanese IV*.

**OCW:** What are the biggest challenges students tend to face in this fourth course in the sequence of Japanese courses at MIT? How do you address these challenges? What tips do you have for other educators teaching this level of Japanese?

**Wakana Maekawa:** Japanese IV is a transition period from the beginning level to the intermediate level. At this level, it’s important for students to start thinking about the audience when they speak/write. They need to organize their ideas and messages and be able to choose the most suitable grammatical structures and vocabulary so that they can better present their ideas or convey their messages to the conversation partner or the audience in Japanese, rather than simply saying everything that comes up in their mind. I explain this to students at the beginning of the semester and encourage them to take risks, not to be afraid of making mistakes, and to expand their possibilities. In order for them to develop such skills, I try to incorporate as many opportunities as possible for them to speak/write a few paragraphs about their memorable experiences and things they are passionate about. Students prepare their short speech/post following a guideline, share it with the class, and then they give comments and feedback to each other.

**OCW:** The focus in 21G.504 is on using socially appropriate language in speaking and writing, with emphasis on the relationship between (and relative social status of) the people involved in a given interaction. Do students unaccustomed to using honorifics find it difficult to understand which forms to use in which circumstances? How do you teach this skill?

**Wakana Maekawa:** Since many students in Japanese IV are interested in doing an internship in Japan through the {{% resource_link "b4c726d8-20ec-4cf1-9b95-5dc6a2fdb2db" "MISTI-Japan" %}} program after completing the course, it’s important for them to understand the socially appropriate language and be able to use it. For many students it seems difficult to understand which forms to use in which circumstances at first, but we teach one form at a time by explaining the concept with many example sentences and provide them with ample opportunities to deepen their understanding and fully acquire the skills through exercises and role plays.

{{< anchor "rubric" >}}{{< /anchor >}}**OCW:** You use a detailed {{% resource_link 325f907e-3fb1-6f23-ba1f-7551a4e101c1 "rubric" %}} in calculating the grades for the two interview tests. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? Do you share this rubric with your students? If so, how is it useful to them?

{{< quote "Each student has strengths and weaknesses, but grading their performance using just a letter grade doesn’t inform them what their strengths and weaknesses are." "— Wakana Maekawa" >}}

**Wakana Maekawa:** The rubric for interview tests consists of seven criteria: task completion; interactional skills; accuracy of grammar and vocabulary; variety of grammar and vocabulary; fluency; pronunciation and intonation; and listening comprehension. Each criterion has detailed descriptions for each score. I share all rubrics, including the one for the interview test, with my students beforehand so that they have a better understanding of the expectations and how they can better prepare for each test and assignment.

Each student has strengths and weaknesses, but grading their performance using just a letter grade doesn’t inform them what their strengths and weaknesses are. For example, an A- could mean that they’re fluent but the variety of grammar and vocabulary is limited. Or it could also mean that their accuracy is good but they need to work more on listening comprehension. A rubric can provide them with clearer and more detailed feedback on their performance and with an opportunity for them to reflect on their Japanese abilities. Understanding their own strengths and weaknesses will also enable them to take more initiative in their Japanese study.
