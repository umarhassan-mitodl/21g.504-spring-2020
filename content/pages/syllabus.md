コースの目標 (もくひょう) Course Objectives
--------------------------------

The main objective of this course is to build up basic skills of communication in Japanese using appropriate speech levels in both writing and speaking for various social settings. This course covers lessons 19 through 23 in the textbook _Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese II_ (see textbook info below). At the completion of this course, you will be able to:

1.  demonstrate correct usage of intermediate grammar, including causative, passive, causative-passive forms of verbs, and some conditionals through various activities;
2.  talk to people who are socially superior to you;
3.  comprehend conversations on various topics spoken at near-natural speed as well as grasp the relationships among the people involved;
4.  read and write 98 new kanji;
5.  write in various forms; and
6.  give brief presentations with specific objectives.

There are two types of class: grammar session and drill session. Prior to the grammar introduction for each lesson, you should read the grammar explanation of the textbook and practice new vocabulary. Prior to drill sessions, it is particularly important to review the patterns being learned, practice new vocabulary orally and memorize them so that you can fully benefit from the oral practice conducted in class.

Throughout the course, we encourage you to do the following:

*   Be an active learner!
*   Be a good collaborator and help each other!
*   Enjoy the class!

10.  _Attendance Policy_
    1.  Attend all sessions. Because of the cumulative nature of language learning, it is essential that you attend all sessions and keep up with the course work on a daily basis. Please follow the online daily schedule and come to class well-prepared.
    2.  _Be punctual_. Coming in late not only results in missed performances and quizzes that may not be made up for, but also distracts other students. Showing up late may affect your daily grade negatively.
